# OptAzur: Optimization in French Riviera

OptAzur is an ongoing effort to foster collaborations among members of Université Côte d'Azur on different aspect of optimization and its applications to machine learning, imaging and signal processing, etc. 

## Seminar

OptAzur organizes a monthly seminar in Nice and Sophia-Antipolis, which alternates between the two sites and takes place on the third Monday of each month.

**Learning Dynamical Systems Via Koopman Operator Regression**

Non-linear dynamical systems can be handily described by the associated Koopman operator, whose action evolves every observable of the system forward in time.
These operators are instrumental to forecasting and interpreting the system dynamics, and have broad applications in science and engineering.
The talk gives a gentle introduction to this topic, with a focus on theory and algorithms.
We highlight the importance of algorithms that allow us to estimate the spectral decomposition of the Koopman operator well and explore how the quest for good representations for these operators can be formulated as an optimization problem involving neural networks.

**One-Line-of-Code Data Mollification Improves Optimization of Likelihood-based Generative Models**

Generative Models (GMs) have attracted considerable attention due to their tremendous success in various domains, such as computer vision where they are capable to generate impressive realistic-looking images. Likelihood-based GMs are attractive due to the possibility to generate new data by a single model evaluation. However, they typically achieve lower sample quality compared to state-of-the-art score-based diffusion models (DMs). This paper provides a significant step in the direction of addressing this limitation. The idea is to borrow one of the strengths of score-based DMs, which is the ability to perform accurate density estimation in low-density regions and to address manifold overfitting by means of data mollification. We propose a view of data mollification within likelihood-based GMs as a continuation method, whereby the optimization objective smoothly transitions from simple-to-optimize to the original target. Crucially, data mollification can be implemented by adding one line of code in the optimization loop, and I will show that this provides a boost in generation quality of likelihood-based GMs, without computational overheads. I will then present results on real-world image data sets and UCI benchmarks with popular likelihood-based GMs, including variants of variational autoencoders and normalizing flows, showing large improvements in FID score and density estimation.
