# OptAzur: Optimization in French Riviera

OptAzur is an ongoing effort to foster collaborations among members of Université Côte d'Azur on different aspect of optimization and its applications to machine learning, imaging and signal processing, etc. 

## Seminar

OptAzur organizes a monthly seminar in Nice and Sophia-Antipolis, which alternates between the two sites and takes place on the third Monday of each month.

### Next talk

Monday, September 18th, 2023 (Salle de conférence, LJAD, Nice)

14h - [Jean-François Aujol](https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~jaujol/) (Université de Bordeaux)

**FISTA is an automatic geometrically optimized algorithm for strongly convex functions**

This work is related with large scale optimization. We are interested in the famous FISTA algorithm. We show that FISTA is an automatic geometrically optimized algorithm for functions satisfying a quadratic growth assumption. This explains why FISTA works better than the standard Forward-Backward algorithm (FB) in such a case, although FISTA is known to have a polynomial asymptotical convergence rate while FB is exponential. We provide a simple rule to tune the α parameter within the FISTA algorithm to reach an ε-solution with an optimal number of iterations. These new results highlight the efficiency of FISTA algorithms, and they rely on new non asymptotic bounds for FISTA.
This is a joint work with Charles Dossal and Aude Rondepierre (INSA Toulouse).
